# [Offical implementation for InstanT: Semi-supervised Learning with instance-dependent thresholds (NeurIPS 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18910)

This repo contains a modified version of [USB (Unified Semi-supervised Learning Benchmark)](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning), with our implementation of InstanT.

To run InstanT on train-from-scratch setup, read instructions from USB first and run

```bash
python train.py --c config/classic_cv/instant/instant_cifar10_40_0.yaml
```
